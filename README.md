"Shanks with MASON" is a framework to simulate different network scenarios in order to add autonomic capabilities using MASON simulation framework.

To achieve this goal, a multi-agent system (MAS) is used to handle possible situations in the scenario. These agents are able to analyse environment data, perform inference and self-healing actions, etc.
