/**
 * Hacker agent is a malicious agent that investigate security failures and try 
 * to exploit them. In this simulation the attacks will be centralized in a
 * single company network (not the World Wide Web).
 * 
 * A hacker can start with the necessary knowledge to perform a certain attack,
 * or no knowledge at all. In the course of the simulation a hacker can learn
 * new knowledge about attacks in general, that can lead to improve his own 
 * skills making attacks or acquire new ones.  
 * 
 * There is a small chance that the Hacker network suffer a failure, in that 
 * case the hacker stops all attacks and malicious actions until the failure 
 * is resolved. Also there is a chance that a hacker is traced back from his 
 * victims, in that case the hacker is put down.
